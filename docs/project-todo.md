# TimeSherpa Project Log

## Current Status (2025-01-02)

### Developer Handover Notes (Updated)
Hello! I'm starting work on the project today. Based on my review of the codebase and requirements, here's what I found:

1. **Email Service is Ready**: The email service already supports SMTP and Gmail integration, not just console mock
2. **All Tests Passing**: ✅ All 64 tests are now passing (1 skipped due to jsdom limitations)
3. **Core Features Complete**: Authentication, calendar analysis, email subscriptions, and dashboard are all working
4. **Branch Status**: We're on `feat-email-subscriptions` branch, 1 commit ahead of origin

### Today's Plan (2025-01-02)
After reviewing the project guide and current state, I believe the most important next steps are:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling** (Medium Priority) ✅ COMPLETED
   - ✅ Added React ErrorBoundary component for catching and displaying errors gracefully
   - ✅ Implemented retry logic for failed API calls with exponential backoff
   - ✅ Added user-friendly error messages for common scenarios
   - ✅ Created comprehensive error handling utilities
   - ✅ Updated hooks to use the new error handling system
   - ✅ Added tests for error handling components
   - ✅ Fixed all failing tests by mocking the retry logic in test environment
   - ✅ Fixed Settings page crash by improving error handling in withRetry
   - ✅ Added comprehensive tests for Settings page (10 new tests)

2. **Performance Optimizations** (Medium Priority) - NEXT UP
   - Add localStorage persistence for offline support
   - Implement loading skeletons instead of full-page loaders
   - Consider code splitting for faster initial load

3. **Documentation Update**
   - Update README with production deployment instructions
   - Document email service configuration for production

### Progress Today
- Created `ErrorBoundary` component that catches React errors and displays a friendly error page
- Implemented `withRetry` utility function that automatically retries failed API calls with exponential backoff
- Created `getErrorMessage` utility that converts technical errors into user-friendly messages
- Updated `useCalendarAnalysis` and Settings page to use the new error handling
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all error handling utilities
- Fixed various test issues related to mocking axios and window.location
- **Fixed all failing tests** by properly mocking the `withRetry` function in the test environment
- **Fixed Settings page crash** by improving the `shouldRetry` logic to check for axios errors
- **Added Settings page tests** with 10 comprehensive test cases covering all functionality
- **Wrapped Settings route with ErrorBoundary** for additional protection

### Technical Notes on Error Handling Implementation
- **ErrorBoundary**: Wraps the entire app to catch unhandled React errors
- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries network errors and 5xx server errors up to 3 times
- **Error Messages**: Maps common HTTP status codes to user-friendly messages
- **AppError Class**: Custom error class for application-specific errors with retry control
- **Test Strategy**: Mocked the `withRetry` function in tests to avoid timing issues with retry delays
- **Settings Page Protection**: Added specific error boundary for Settings route with fallback UI

### Known Issues
- The window.location.reload test in ErrorBoundary is skipped due to jsdom limitations (not a functional issue, just a testing limitation)

### Next Developer Handover Notes
The error handling implementation is complete and all tests are passing! The Settings page crash has been fixed. The main areas to focus on next are:

1. **Performance Optimizations**: The app could benefit from:
   - LocalStorage caching of calendar data
   - Loading skeletons for better perceived performance
   - Code splitting for faster initial load

2. **Production Readiness**:
   - Ensure ENCRYPTION_KEY is set in production
   - Configure proper email service (SMTP/Gmail)
   - Add monitoring for failed API calls and retries
   - Update README with deployment instructions

3. **Feature Enhancements** (from the todo list):
   - Export calendar analysis as PDF/CSV
   - Compare time trends across multiple months
   - Team/organization-wide analytics (enterprise feature)

The error handling foundation is solid and will provide a much better user experience when things go wrong. The app is now more production-ready with proper error handling and retry logic.

### Recently Completed Features ✅
- **Email Subscriptions**: Full implementation with daily/weekly email summaries
- **State Management**: CalendarAnalysisContext with 10-minute caching prevents redundant API calls
- **Dashboard Improvements**: Added "Opportunities for Improvement" section with dynamic recommendations
- **Data Freshness**: Visual indicators show when data was last updated (green for fresh, yellow for stale)
- **Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary re-fetching when navigating between pages
- **Security**: Removed debug logging that could expose sensitive information
- **Testing**: All 31 unit tests passing with comprehensive coverage

### Active Issues & Tasks

#### High Priority
- [ ] **Production Email Service**: Implement real email sending (currently using console mock)
  - [ ] Configure SMTP/Gmail integration
  - [ ] Test email delivery in production environment
  - [ ] Add email delivery monitoring/logging

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Enhanced Error Handling**
  - [ ] Add user-friendly error messages for common scenarios
  - [ ] Implement retry logic for failed API calls
  - [ ] Add error boundaries for React components
  
- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**
  - [ ] Add localStorage persistence for offline support
  - [ ] Implement loading skeletons instead of full-page loaders
  - [ ] Consider code splitting for faster initial load

#### Low Priority
- [ ] **Additional Features**
  - [ ] Export calendar analysis as PDF/CSV
  - [ ] Compare time trends across multiple months
  - [ ] Team/organization-wide analytics (enterprise feature)
  - [ ] Mobile app (React Native)

### Environment Requirements
- **ENCRYPTION_KEY**: Required in production (64 hex characters)
- **GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY**: Required for AI analysis
- **EMAIL_SERVICE**: Set to 'smtp' or 'gmail' for production
- **SMTP/Gmail credentials**: Required for email delivery

### Quick Start for New Developers
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd app && npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Architecture Notes
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express + TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Data Storage**: JSON file with encrypted tokens
- **Email Service**: Pluggable architecture (console/SMTP/Gmail)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
