- Added environment variables for email configuration
- Created unit tests for JsonUserRepository and email services
- **Implemented comprehensive state management solution:**
  - CalendarAnalysisContext for centralized state management
  - Data caching with 10-minute staleness threshold
  - Loading state management across components
  - Manual refresh functionality with visual indicators
  - Seamless navigation between Dashboard and Settings
  - Data freshness indicators and automatic cache invalidation
  - Prevention of redundant API calls

### Notes
- The system now supports persistent user data storage with encrypted refresh tokens
- Email service supports multiple providers (console for testing, SMTP, Gmail)
- Scheduled jobs run at 8 AM daily and weekly (Mondays)
- Frontend includes full subscription management UI with state persistence
- All new features have been tested with unit tests
- **State management prevents unnecessary calendar re-analysis when navigating**
- **Dashboard shows data freshness and provides manual refresh capability**
- **Settings page integrates with analysis state and provides contextual guidance**

### Next Steps
- Run the application and test the complete user experience
- Test email sending with actual SMTP/Gmail configuration
- Consider adding more sophisticated email analytics
- Add email open tracking (optional)

## Previous Notes

### Completed Tasks
- Project structure created with /app and /docs directories
- Google OAuth configuration set up (client ID and secret)
- Project requirements documented in project-guide.md
- **Phase 1: Project Setup & Dependencies** (Create package.json, TypeScript config, build tools, Tailwind CSS)
- **Phase 2: Backend Setup** (Express server, Google OAuth, API routes, Calendar & Gemini integration)
- **Phase 3: Frontend Setup** (React app, landing page, OAuth flow, dashboard layout, loading states)
