# TimeSherpa Project Log

## Current Status (2025-01-02)

### Recently Completed Features âœ…
- **Email Subscriptions**: Full implementation with daily/weekly email summaries
- **State Management**: CalendarAnalysisContext with 10-minute caching prevents redundant API calls
- **Dashboard Improvements**: Added "Opportunities for Improvement" section with dynamic recommendations
- **Data Freshness**: Visual indicators show when data was last updated (green for fresh, yellow for stale)
- **Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary re-fetching when navigating between pages
- **Security**: Removed debug logging that could expose sensitive information
- **Testing**: All 31 unit tests passing with comprehensive coverage

### Active Issues & Tasks

#### High Priority
- [ ] **Production Email Service**: Implement real email sending (currently using console mock)
  - [ ] Configure SMTP/Gmail integration
  - [ ] Test email delivery in production environment
  - [ ] Add email delivery monitoring/logging

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Enhanced Error Handling**
  - [ ] Add user-friendly error messages for common scenarios
  - [ ] Implement retry logic for failed API calls
  - [ ] Add error boundaries for React components
  
- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**
  - [ ] Add localStorage persistence for offline support
  - [ ] Implement loading skeletons instead of full-page loaders
  - [ ] Consider code splitting for faster initial load

#### Low Priority
- [ ] **Additional Features**
  - [ ] Export calendar analysis as PDF/CSV
  - [ ] Compare time trends across multiple months
  - [ ] Team/organization-wide analytics (enterprise feature)
  - [ ] Mobile app (React Native)

### Environment Requirements
- **ENCRYPTION_KEY**: Required in production (64 hex characters)
- **GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY**: Required for AI analysis
- **EMAIL_SERVICE**: Set to 'smtp' or 'gmail' for production
- **SMTP/Gmail credentials**: Required for email delivery

### Next Developer Handover Notes
1. The app uses a JSON-based user repository (`/data/users.json`) for simplicity
2. Refresh tokens are encrypted using AES-256-GCM
3. Calendar analysis is cached for 10 minutes to reduce API costs
4. Email jobs run at 8 AM (daily) and Monday 8 AM (weekly)
5. The Dashboard shows real-time recommendations based on calendar patterns
6. All sensitive logging has been removed for security

### Quick Start for New Developers

```

### Architecture Notes
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express + TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Data Storage**: JSON file with encrypted tokens
- **Email Service**: Pluggable architecture (console/SMTP/Gmail)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
