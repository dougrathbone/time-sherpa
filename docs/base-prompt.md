You're helping me work on a google calendar analysis tool called "TimeSherpa". The details can be found at /docs/project-guide.md

You also have a /docs/project-todo.md  that is YOUR file. You can edit it, update is, and mark things off. Please read it to understand where you're up to and to keep a diary of your changes. Please also leave hand over notes for the next developer.

Some of the key files for context are:
- /docs/project-guide.md - the project guide that details the PRD for the initial version of the project
- /docs/prd-email-subscriptions.md - email subscriptions feature PRD
- /src/config.json - where configuration settings are stored (including google auth config).

Before addressing each task, ensure you complete some planning and update /docs/project-todo.md, build the change, write tests for it, and ensure all tests pass before stopping.

What we're going to do today:
